            Stress is a natural physical and mental reaction to life
            experiences. Everyone expresses stress from time to time. Anything
            from everyday responsibilities like work and family to serious life
            events such as a new diagnosis, war, or the death of a loved one can
            trigger stress. For short-term situations, stress can be beneficial
            to your health and helps you cope with potentially serious
            situations. Your body responds to stress by releasing hormones that
            increase your heart and breathing rates and ready your muscles to
            respond, known as the &apos;fight or flight&apos;response.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
            Yet if your stress response doesn&apos;t stop firing, and these
            stress levels stay elevated far longer than is necessary for
            survival, it can take a massive toll on your health. (Marks 2021) .
            When discussing stress, it is usually the psychological aftereffects
            that are highlighted and talked about, like depression and anxiety.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
            However, neurotic levels of stress can also lead to severe
            physiological dysfunction also. Under stress, your heart starts
            pumping faster. Stress hormones cause your blood vessels to
            constrict and divert more oxygen to your muscles, so you&apos;ll
            have more strength to take action. Except: this also raises your
            blood pressure, and chronically high blood pressure can potentially
            lead to cardiovascular diseases. How?
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
            When blood rapidly clashes with the vessels at higher-than-normal
            pressure, our veins and arteries experience little episodes of
            damage, and this leads to inflammation and plaque build-up in them.
            The plaque attracts fat and cholesterol, and the build-up eventually
            narrows your blood vessels. In extreme cases, this kind of stress
            can also lead to strokes and heart attacks.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
            Chronic stress can also lead to stiff muscles, acidity, fertility
            problems, shortness of breath, prolonged back pain, stomachaches and
            many other health issues.

            Stress can have an impact on capillaries, which are small blood
            vessels that play a critical role in the body&apos;s circulation.
            Capillaries are responsible for exchanging nutrients, oxygen, and
            waste products between the blood and the body&apos;s cells. They are
            found throughout the body, including in the skin, muscles, and
            organs. When the body experiences chronic stress, it can lead to the
            constriction of blood vessels, including capillaries. This can
            reduce blood flow to certain areas of the body and potentially lead
            to physical symptoms such as headache or dizziness. In addition to
            constricting blood vessels, stress can also cause other changes in
            the body that can affect blood circulation. For example, stress can
            cause the heart to beat faster, which can lead to an increase in
            blood pressure. This can also impact blood circulation, as the
            increased pressure may make it more difficult for the blood to flow
            freely through the body.

            <span className="font-bold">So where does Hijama come in?</span>
            Stress eventually causes constriction of blood vessels & impairment
            of Capillaries which are underlying factor through which so many
            diseases are triggered due to stress. Hijama Cupping does exactly
            opposite to the what chronic stress does! Hijama dilates blood
            vessels with action of certain vasodilators such as adenosine and
            histamine, promoting blood circulation, contributing to the
            relaxation of blood vessels and potentially reducing the degree of
            constriction. The increase in blood flow to the treated area
            potentially alleviates vasoconstriction. Additionally Hijama cupping
            if preceded with Gliding Cupping techniques, increases blood
            circulation and vasodilation. These combined approaches potentially
            enhances the overall impact on vasoconstriction.

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
            When stress builds up and cumulate in the body the capillaries
            contract and over time they get stiff, calcified, almost dead and
            can no longer function and we get a buildup of poor tissue that
            feels dead and hard and cold and fatigue pain stiffness and even
            brain fog can all the symptoms of poor circulation Hijama Cupping is
            the permanent and effective solution to this situation as it breaks
            down the dysfunctional capillaries and allow the body to hit the
            restart button. Hijama Cupping, through its suction effect on the
            skin breaks/ruptures the dysfunctional capillaries, clears the mild
            to moderate blood stasis (Statis referred here is impairment of
            blood flow not blood clots as considered in western medicine). Body
            regrows new capillaries and restores the microcirculation in the
            treated areas. Enhanced blood flow may promote the delivery of
            oxygen and nutrients to tissues, as well as the removal of metabolic
            waste products, potentially aiding in reversing the stress effects.
            Stress often manifests in the body as muscular tension and
            tightness. Cupping therapy, by targeting specific areas of tension
            helps release tight muscles and promote a sense of relaxation.

            Hijama (and dry cupping) also sedates the nervous system&apos;s
            processes and therefore relieves any stress the patient might be
            feeling at that time.

            At i-Revive the gliding cupping done before the Hijama process is
            extremely beneficial for stress-related issues. Neurotic stress can
            cause irreversible damages to our bodies and snowball into much
            serious health concerns than what may seem like a straightforward
            case of anxiety. The benefits of pursuing Hijama for stress-related
            concerns are many and should not be overridden for a life controlled
            by cabinets full of pills.
