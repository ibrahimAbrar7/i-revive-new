            Like any practice, there are certain protocols that make Hijama much
            more effective, when done in accordance with. Listed below are some
            precautionary measures that will ensure you achieve the best
            possible results out of your Hijama session.

            The 17th, 19th and 21st of the Hijri month are generally regarded as
            the Sunnah days of Hijama. Anas RA narrated,“The Prophet (S.A.W)
            would get cupped in his jugular veins and his upper back. And he
            would get cupped on the seventeenth (of the month), (or) the
            nineteenth, and (or) the twenty first.&quot; Although the hadith of
            specific dates regarding Hijama are da&apos;if (weak), they are
            still given importance over other dates due to scientific backing
            and preference over self-judgement. The middle of the month is a
            time when the moon is in its full phase. The full moon phase affects
            the heart&apos;s performance, blood flow, and the human hormonal
            system. This condition occurs because the effect of the magnetic
            field and the intensity of moonlight during the full moon directly
            affects the levels of the hormone melatonin in the blood.
            (Syahruramdhani, Risdiana and Setyawan 2020) A similar effect can be
            noticed in the change in oceanic tides due to the full moon&apos;s
            gravitational pull.

            The Sunnah points are those Hijama sites that were recommended by
            the Prophet SAW. They include two points on the head, two points on
            either side of the neck, one point at the base of the neck, two
            points near the groin area and one point between the first two toes
            (on each foot). These points are all covered in the various sessions
            of our Sectional Cleanse plan.

              Empty Stomachs on Early Mornings
            </span>{" "}
            <br />
            Hijama is recommended to be done on an empty stomach; the most
            optimal time being in the early morning before breakfast. This is
            the most important condition, i.e. the patient should have an empty
            stomach. <br />
            The reason for this is because during the night, the toxins and
            impurities in the blood accumulate in the certain regions where
            Hijamah is done and remain there until a person eats. When a meal is
            taken blood is redirected to the digestive organs to enable the
            process of digestion and absorption. The toxins and impurities are
            therefore recirculated throughout the body instead of being
            concentrated in the Hijamah areas and also there is less blood in
            the superficial or outer parts of the body. If Hijamah Cupping is
            done in this condition it can lead to illness. When Hijamah Cupping
            is done on a person who has just eaten it often results in vertigo
            or syncope (fainting).

              Healthy Diet and Plenty of Hydration
            </span>{" "}
            <br />
            After your Hijama session, a healthy meal void of red meats, milk
            products or oily foods should be consumed. The body had just started
            to work on internal cleansing, rejuvenation and healing, and this is
            done by sending rush of blood to the cupped sites. But if one takes
            heavy food then the body diverts the supplies to digest the food and
            hence the reduced benefit. Good care should be taken to drink
            plentiful water. Hijama also acts as a sedative for your nervous
            system and slows down your heart rate, so capitalize on that relaxed
            state and take a short nap too. <br />
            Caution: Some people may catch cold with feverish feeling if Milk or
            milk based products are consumed post hijama. We strictly suggest
            clients to stay away from milk on day of Hijama post session.

            <span className="text-2xl">Summer Heat</span> <br />
            Blood is one of the foremost receptors of external heat and acts as
            a transport through which internal body heat is regulated through
            blood flow. Hijama is the perfect outlet for body heat, as it helps
            regulate body temperature by releasing toxic heat through the
            incisions (along with the cupped blood). Such a change can be noted
            through the vapor that fogs up the Hijama cup and turns it from
            translucent to a milky white color. Thus, the period before the
            intense summer heat sets in is the perfect season for
            Hijama.(Sheikho 2012)
            <br />
            With that being said, there is no stringently allocated time
            suitable for Hijama, and it can be undergone at any time of the
            year. The Prophet SAW performed Hijama for many reasons (outside of
            the Sunnah days), such as for wounds and poisoning.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
            The best state to do Hijama in is when one is healthy and illness
            has not set in, for it acts mainly as a blood cleanser and a
            preventative medicine. It&apos;s like the saying goes: better be
            safe than sorry
