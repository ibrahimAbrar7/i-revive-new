                What Is Cupping Therapy?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
                Cupping therapy involves the use of glass, silicone, or bamboo cups
                that create suction on the skin. This suction increases blood
                circulation stimulates the immune system, and helps detoxify the
                body. The therapy is believed to release tension, reduce
                inflammation, and promote healing by drawing stagnant blood to the
                surface. <br />
                There are two main types of cupping:
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
                1. <span className="font-bold">Dry Cupping:</span> This involves
                placing cups on specific areas of the body to create suction without
                any cutting of the skin.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-justify">
                2. <span className="font-bold">Wet Cupping (Hijama):</span> In this
                method, small incisions are made on the skin before placing the
                cups. This allows a small amount of blood to be drawn out, removing
                toxins from the body. For those interested in personalized treatment
                plans, it&apos;s essential to choose a center that tailors therapy
                to individual health needs.
