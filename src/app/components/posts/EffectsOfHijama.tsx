            hijama cupping benefits Hijama Cupping therapy bestows a range of
            benefits: it enhances blood circulation, dismantles dysfunctional or
            deceased capillaries, fostering the regeneration of new capillaries
            and reinstating microcirculation. It aids in the clearance of
            stagnant blood from injury sites and inactive capillaries,
            stimulates the lymphatic system, augments microcirculation,
            expedites tissue healing and the formation of blood vessels in
            affected areas. The negative pressure activates mechanoreceptors,
            contributes to detoxification by eliminating diverse toxins and
            heavy metals, facilitates the attainment of homeostasis, addresses
            hormonal imbalances, reduces total cholesterol and modifies the
            LDL/HDL ratio, prompts the peripheral nervous system, mitigates
            pain, regulates blood pressure, fortifies the immune system,
            triggers the body&apos;s self-cleansing mechanisms primarily at the
            cupping sites, alleviates muscle tension, acts as a natural
            anticoagulant, encourages the release of nitric oxide, induces
            vasodilation, extracts metabolic waste and deep-seated toxins to the
            surface, fosters general comfort and relaxation, heightens red blood
            cell count in mild to moderate anemia, alleviates inflammation, and
            significantly diminishes blood sugar levels in individuals with
            diabetes.

            These effects align with the body&apos;s intrinsic processes.
            Nonetheless, chronic stress, lifestyle concerns, inadequate dietary
            habits, processed food consumption, sedentary living, alcohol abuse,
            suppressive medications, excessive sugar intake, lack of exercise,
            and emotional and physical abuse can disrupt these processes,
            impeding optimal bodily functions and serving as underlying causes
            of ailments. Regular implementation of Hijama Cupping supports and
            restores these functions, serving as both a preventive measure for
            the body and a remedial procedure for existing illnesses or
            conditions stemming from compromised functions and their subsequent
            consequences. .

            There is converging evidence that cupping can induce comfort and
            relaxation on a systemic level and the resulting increase in
            endogenous opioid production in the brain leads to improved pain
            control.1 Other researchers proposed that the main action of cupping
            therapy is to enhance the circulation of blood and to remove toxins
            and waste from the body. 2 That could be achieved through improving
            microcirculation, promoting capillary endothelial cell repair,
            accelerating granulation and angiogenesis in the regional tissues,
            thus helping normalize the patient&apos;s functional state and
            progressive muscle relaxation.3,4 Cupping also removes noxious
            materials from skin microcirculation and interstitial compartment 5
            which benefit the patient. Cupping may be an effective method of
            reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL) in men and consequently may
            have a preventive effect against atherosclerosis 6 and
            cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Cupping is known to significantly
            decrease in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein LDL/high
            density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio.7 Cupping therapy can significantly
            lower the number of lymphocytes in the local blood related to the
            affected area with an increase in the number of neutrophils, which
            is one of the antiviral mechanisms that reduces the pain scores.8
            Loss of blood along with vasodilation tends to increase the
            parasympathetic activity and relaxes the body muscles which benefit
            the patient and could also be associated with the after effects of
            cupping. Furthermore, the loss of blood is thought to increase the
            quality of the remaining blood that improves pain symptoms.9 It has
            also been found that cupping increases red blood cells RBCs.10 It
            has been claimed that cupping therapy tends to drain excess fluids
            and toxins, loosen adhesions and revitalize connective tissue,
            increase blood flow to skin and muscles, stimulate the peripheral
            nervous system, reduce pain, controls high blood pressure and
            modulates the immune system.11,12 Some researchers believe that the
            build-up of toxins is the main reason for illness development. In
            the cupped region, blood vessels are dilated by the action of
            certain vasodilators such as adenosine, noradrenaline and histamine.
            Consequently, there is an increase in the circulation of blood to
            the ill area. This allows the immediate elimination of trapped
            toxins in the tissues, and, hence, the patient feels better.13
            Cupping has been found to improve subcutaneous blood flow and to
            stimulate the autonomic nervous system.14,15 Like injuries to the
            skin due to the incisions, stimulation of the skin causes several
            autonomic, hormonal, and immune reactions attributed to the
            sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent nerves to the
            somato-visceral reflexes related to the organs.16 Cupping is
            reported to restore sympathovagal balance and might be
            cardio-protective by stimulating the peripheral sympathetic and
            parasympathetic nervous system.17 Cupping seems to play a role in
            the activation of complement system as well as modulation of
            cellular part of immune system.18 There is also a significant
            reduction in blood sugar in diabetic patients after cupping.19 Chen
            and colleagues concluded that there are some improvements in the
            research concerning the mechanisms of cupping therapy.20 Overall,
            cupping is reported to effect changes in the biomechanical
            properties of the skin,21 increase immediate pain thresholds in
            patients with neck pain and in a healthy subject as well,22 reduce
            significantly peripheral and local P substance 23 and reduce the
            inflammation.24
